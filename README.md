# Bamazon
### MySQL database with Node interface

### Bamazon is an Amazon like storefront made with MySQL and Node.

### The application had two parts.  

### The first bamzonCustomer.js, will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory, then display their order and total.

### The second part, bamazonManager.js allows user to choose between four choices.

* View products for sale.
* View low inventory.
* Add to inventory.
* Add new products.

### Both applications work with the MySQL database, adding, removing or updating products as chosen by user.
